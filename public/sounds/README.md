# Game Sound Files

This directory contains placeholder files for the game sound effects. To make the game fully functional, you need to replace these placeholder files with actual MP3 sound files.

## Required Sound Files

1. `flap.mp3` - A short, light sound for when the player taps to make the champagne cork flap upward.
2. `collision.mp3` - A sound effect for when the player collides with an obstacle or the screen boundaries.
3. `background.mp3` - A looping background music track that plays during gameplay.

## Recommended Sound Characteristics

- **flap.mp3**: Short (0.1-0.3 seconds), light, and playful sound.
- **collision.mp3**: Short (0.2-0.5 seconds), impact sound.
- **background.mp3**: 8-bit style music that loops seamlessly, 1-2 minutes in length.

## How to Add Sound Files

1. Create or obtain appropriate sound files in MP3 format.
2. Replace the placeholder files in this directory with your actual sound files, keeping the same filenames.
3. Make sure the files are properly optimized for web use (compressed, reasonable file size).

## Sound Credits

If you use third-party sound effects or music, make sure to include appropriate credits in your project documentation.
