# Game Assets

This directory contains SVG images used in the Flappy Bird-style game.

## Current Assets

1. `champagne-cork.svg` - The player character, a flying champagne cork.
2. `donut.svg` - The obstacles that the player must avoid.
3. `star.svg` - Decorative elements for the background.

## How to Customize

You can customize these assets by editing the SVG files or replacing them with your own images. If you replace them with raster images (PNG, JPG), make sure to update the file references in the `GameCanvas.js` component.

## Recommended Customizations

- **champagne-cork.svg**: You could replace this with a bottle of Freixenet or another themed character.
- **donut.svg**: You could replace this with trivia cards, mozzarella sticks, or other themed obstacles.
- **star.svg**: You could replace this with garden elements like flowers or leaves.

## Image Credits

If you use third-party images, make sure to include appropriate credits in your project documentation.
